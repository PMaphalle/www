# Problem Statement

### Challenges in the Online Application System

- **Difficulty in Finding and Accessing the Website:**
  - The website for applying is hard to find and access. When trying to apply or login, the system sometimes crashes, requiring repeated attempts.

- **Lack of Validation/Security:**
  - Some students can trick the system into getting meal packages while they are bursary funded. Some bursary-funded students share the approved letter and edit it according to their preferred details, which is not valid and accurate.

- **Meal Preference:**
  - Certain students either have allergies to certain products or prefer some of the products included in the package. As a result, they either give away or discard the items they do not want or are allergic to.

- **Long Queues:**
  - Long queues are created because students are expected to fetch their packages at a certain time, which leads to them missing important classes.

- **Lack of Communication:**
  - There is a lack of communication between GOG (Gift of Givers) and the students. Hence, some students end up not receiving their meal packages because they do not get notified of the collection date.

# Proposed Solutions

- **Introduction of a Mobile Application for Students and a Website for Admins:**
  - The mobile application shall be provided for students, while the admin is provided with the website to manage operations.

- **Integration with UJ Databases for Validation of Bursary Status:**
  - The system shall be linked with UJ databases for validation of bursary status. Bursary funded students will not be eligible to apply for meals (unless there is an allowance delay).

- **Customization of Meal Packages:**
  - Upon successful application, students will be granted the freedom to filter/choose what their meal package should have.

- **Notification System for Package Collection:**
  - Students will be notified once their packages are ready for collection, which reduces long queues.

- **Implementation of Unique QR Codes for Collection:**
  - Each student will receive a unique QR code which will be scanned upon collection. In this case, it will also accurately validate a student to avoid fraudulent activities.
